      <font size="6"><b>About the Department</b></font>
      <font size="5">
    <p>  
    The Bengali Department of this college started its journey from 1879 (intermediate). Intellectuals from
    other disciplines devoted their time for teaching Bengali, because the college had no separate teacher 
    for Bengali in its early stage. Pandit Madan Mohan Tarkalankar, Kabi Kamini Roy and many other reputed 
    teachers took regular classes for a long time in Bengali Department for the necessary momentum.
    The department formally started functioning in 1943. Smt. Bharati Mukherjee joined as the first lecturer
   in Bengali. In 1948, Prof. Lila Roy joined, followed by Dr. Dipti Tripathi as Assistant Professor. 
   Smt. Sunanda Dasgupta for some time and Smt. Kamala Kanjilal served the department for many years. 
   The department gathered the critical mass of faculties in 1979, after joining of many eminent academics such 
      as Dr. Uma Roy, Karabi Bhattacharyya, Smt. Sanghamitra Dutta, Smt. Chandra Mukherjee, Smt. Shanta Sen, 
      Smt. Krishna Palit and Smt. Banimanjari Das.</p>

    <p>In keeping with the NAAC Peer Team's recommendation, a Post Graduate course was introduced in the year 2014.
     The Post Graduate Department was granted academic autonomy and conducting the examination and being in charge
    of the examination process. From the session 2018-19 the PG course has been undertaken directly by the 
     University of Calcutta. Presently the Department has ten fulltime teachers, including 4 Associate Professors
      and 6 Assistant Professors. Eminent teachers and educationists from various fields regularly share their 
      knowledge and skill with our students as guest faculty.</p>
