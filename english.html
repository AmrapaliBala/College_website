      <font size="6"><b>About the Department</b></font>
      <font size="5">
    <p>The Department of English is the first department to have been set up in this heritage institution. 
     A. W. Croft had arranged the transfer of BabooSosi Bhushan Dutt, 'a master of English and of Philosophy',
    from Ravenshaw College, Cuttack to Bethune College (then part of Bethune School) in Calcutta, to teach 
    Kadambini Basu in the F.A. class. In 1890. Bethune College opened its course in B.A. (Honours) Examination
   of Calcutta University with three women candidates among whom Sarala Ghosal (later Sarala Devi Choudhurani)
   scored the highest marks and won the Padmavati Gold Medal. The English department made great progress under
   the guidance of dedicated teachers like Prof. Sujata Chaudhuri, Prof. Karuna Chakraborty; Prof. Manisha Sen,
   Prof Ishita Dutta and Prof. Santa Mahalanobis. At present, the department has six full-time teachers.<p/>

  <p>According to the NAAC Peer Team's recommendation, a Postgraduate Course was introduced in the year 2007. 
  The department maintains a healthy balance between tradition and modernity, academics and culture. Regular
  seminars and workshops are organized in the department for the students. A Students' Exchange Programme 
  has been initiated in collaboration with Hooghly Mohsin College from June 2021. This has received very good
  response  from students of both institutions at the UG and PG level.</p>

  <p>Our students fare well in academic as well as extracurricular activities. Regular and strict schedule of 
  classes  and  tutorials as well as remedial classes for slow learners ensure their academic development.
  The department also has a good percentage of progression to postgraduate level. In the recent past, many of 
  our students have cleared the National Eligibility Test (NET) for Lectureship in colleges. The department
  is proud of its students.</p></font>
